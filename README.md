Building and integrating into your CMake project
---

```sh
cmake <ImGui-SFML repo folder> -DIMGUI_DIR=<ImGui repo folder> -DSFML_DIR=<path with built SFML>
```

If you have SFML installed on your system, you don't need to set SFML_DIR during
configuration.

You can also specify `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to build ImGui-SFML as a shared library. To build ImGui-SFML examples, set `IMGUI_SFML_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`.

After the building, you can install the library on your system by running:
```sh
cmake --build . --target install
```

If you set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` during configuration, you can install ImGui-SFML locally.

Integrating into your project is simple.
```cmake
find_package(ImGui-SFML REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE ImGui-SFML::ImGui-SFML)
```

If CMake can't find ImGui-SFML on your system, just define `ImGui-SFML_DIR` before calling `find_package`.

Integrating into your project manually
---
- Download [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- Add ImGui folder to your include directories
- Add `imgui.cpp` and `imgui_draw.cpp` to your build/project
- Copy the contents of `imconfig-SFML.h` to your `imconfig.h` file. (to be able to cast `ImVec2` to `sf::Vector2f` and vice versa)
- Add a folder which contains `imgui-SFML.h` to your include directories
- Add `imgui-SFML.cpp` to your build/project
- Link OpenGL if you get linking errors

Using ImGui-SFML in your code
---

- Call `ImGui::SFML::Init` and pass your `sf::Window` + `sf::RenderTarget` or `sf::RenderWindow` there. You can create your font atlas and pass the pointer in Init too, otherwise the default internal font atlas will be created for you.
- For each iteration of a game loop:
    - Poll and process events:

        ```cpp
        sf::Event event;
        while (window.pollEvent(event)) {
            ImGui::SFML::ProcessEvent(event);
            ...
        }
        ```

    - Call `ImGui::SFML::Update(window, deltaTime)` where `deltaTime` is `sf::Time`. You can also pass mousePosition and displaySize yourself instead of passing the window.
    - Call ImGui functions (`ImGui::Begin()`, `ImGui::Button()`, etc.)
    - Call `ImGui::EndFrame` after the last `ImGui::End` in your update function, if you update more than once before rendering. (e.g. fixed delta game loops)
    - Call `ImGui::SFML::Render(window)`

- Call `ImGui::SFML::Shutdown()` after `window.close()` has been called

**If you only draw ImGui widgets without any SFML stuff, then you'll have to call window.resetGLStates() before rendering anything. You only need to do it once.**

Example code
----

See example file [here](examples/main.cpp)

```cpp
#include "imgui.h"
#include "imgui-SFML.h"

#include <SFML/Graphics/RenderWindow.hpp>
#include <SFML/System/Clock.hpp>
#include <SFML/Window/Event.hpp>
#include <SFML/Graphics/CircleShape.hpp>

int main()
{
    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(640, 480), "ImGui + SFML = <3");
    window.setFramerateLimit(60);
    ImGui::SFML::Init(window);

    sf::CircleShape shape(100.f);
    shape.setFillColor(sf::Color::Green);

    sf::Clock deltaClock;
    while (window.isOpen()) {
        sf::Event event;
        while (window.pollEvent(event)) {
            ImGui::SFML::ProcessEvent(event);

            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed) {
                window.close();
            }
        }

        ImGui::SFML::Update(window, deltaClock.restart());

        ImGui::Begin("Hello, world!");
        ImGui::Button("Look at this pretty button");
        ImGui::End();

        window.clear();
        window.draw(shape);
        ImGui::SFML::Render(window);
        window.display();
    }

    ImGui::SFML::Shutdown();
}
```

Fonts how-to
---

Default font is loaded if you don't pass `false` in `ImGui::SFML::Init`. Call `ImGui::SFML::Init(window, false);` if you don't want default font to be loaded.

* Load your fonts like this:

```cpp
IO.Fonts->Clear(); // clear fonts if you loaded some before (even if only default one was loaded)
// IO.Fonts->AddFontDefault(); // this will load default font as well
IO.Fonts->AddFontFromFileTTF("font1.ttf", 8.f);
IO.Fonts->AddFontFromFileTTF("font2.ttf", 12.f);

ImGui::SFML::UpdateFontTexture(); // important call: updates font texture
```

* And use them like this:

```cpp
ImGui::PushFont(ImGui::GetIO().Fonts->Fonts[0]);
ImGui::Button("Look at this pretty button");
ImGui::PopFont();

ImGui::PushFont(ImGui::GetIO().Fonts->Fonts[1]);
ImGui::TextUnformatted("IT WORKS!");
ImGui::PopFont();
```

The first loaded font is treated as the default one and doesn't need to be pushed with `ImGui::PushFont`.

SFML related ImGui overloads / new widgets
---

There are some useful overloads implemented for SFML objects (see header for overloads):
```cpp
ImGui::Image(const sf::Sprite& sprite);
ImGui::Image(const sf::Texture& texture);
ImGui::ImageButton(const sf::Sprite& sprite);
ImGui::ImageButton(const sf::Texture& texture);
```

Mouse cursors
---
You can change your cursors in ImGui like this:

```cpp
ImGui::SetMouseCursor(ImGuiMouseCursor_TextInput);
```

By default, your system cursor will change and will be rendered by your system. If you want SFML to draw your cursor with default ImGui cursors (the system cursor will be hidden), do this:

```cpp
ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
io.MouseDrawCursor = true;
```

Keyboard/Gamepad navigation
---
Starting with [ImGui 1.60](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.60), there's a feature to control ImGui with keyboard and gamepad. To use keyboard navigation, you just need to do this:

```cpp
ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard;
```

Gamepad navigation requires more work, unless you have XInput gamepad, in which case the mapping is automatically set for you. But you can still set it up for your own gamepad easily, just take a look how it's done for the default mapping [here](https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml/blob/navigation/imgui-SFML.cpp#L697). And then you need to do this:

```cpp
ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard;
```
By default, the first active joystick is used for navigation, but you can set joystick id explicitly like this:
```cpp
ImGui::SFML::SetActiveJoystickId(5);
```

High DPI screens
----

As SFML is not currently DPI aware, your window/gui may show at the incorrect scale. This is particularly noticeable on Apple systems with Retina displays.

To fix this on macOS, you can create an app bundle (as opposed to just the exe) then modify the info.plist so that "High Resolution Capable" is set to "NO"
